# CHANGELOG

## Phase 1 import template verification (2026-07-01)

### Verified
- The downloaded Actual Spend workbook uses the parser's canonical columns exactly: Source, Reference No, Spend Type, Project, Amount, Start Date, End Date, Vendor / Program, and Description.
- Both workbook examples parse and validate successfully.
- `YYYY-MM` and `YYYY-MM-DD` are supported and documented; Start Date and End Date must use the same format.
- `Others` remains valid because it is part of the shared Spend Type master. Unknown values are rejected.
- New Manual / Historical imports continue through editable manual-expense persistence and support soft deletion.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for the exact template header contract, both date formats, template sample validation, and the valid `Others` Spend Type.
- No production behavior or UI was changed.

## Revised Phase 1 — Unify Actual Spend Excel import persistence (2026-07-01)

### Scope
Route **new** Actual Spend Excel imports whose `Source` is "Manual / Historical" into the
existing manual expense persistence path (`orbit-pmo-manual-expenses-v1`), so imported rows
become editable and soft-deletable exactly like manually added rows. Imports with `Source`
"Approved Memo" or "Infra Cost" are unchanged — they continue to write directly to canonical
Actual Spend as read-only reporting records, preserving legacy behavior.

### Files changed
- `views/budget.js`
- `tests/budget-expenses.test.js`

### What changed
- Added `manualExpenseFromImportedActualSpend(record)`: converts a validated, canonical-shaped
  imported Actual Spend row into the same object shape the manual expense form saves. A row
  whose coverage spans exactly one month (or has no/partial dates) becomes a `one_time` manual
  expense with the full imported amount; a row spanning more than one month becomes a `monthly`
  manual expense whose stored per-month amount is `total ÷ coverageMonths`, so re-multiplying by
  `coverageMonths` (the existing manual→canonical projection logic) reproduces the original
  imported total instead of double-counting it.
- Added `promoteImportedManualExpenses(records)`: after `importActualSpendRecords()` writes
  validated rows to canonical storage (unchanged), this moves any `Manual / Historical Expense`
  sourced rows into the manual expense store via the existing `saveManualExpenseAsync()`, then
  removes their direct-canonical copy so the existing `reconcileActualSpendSources()` re-projects
  them the same way manually added expenses are projected (with an `actual-spend-manual-` id).
- `handleActualSpendImport()` now calls `promoteImportedManualExpenses(result.records)` after a
  successful import, before re-rendering. No change to file parsing, column mapping, validation,
  or the "all-or-nothing" / duplicate-skip behavior.
- `showActualSpendGroup()` (the Actual Spend report's drill-down panel) now shows a **Void**
  button next to any record that resolves to an editable manual expense (source is
  `Manual / Historical Expense` and its id exists in the manual expense store), calling the
  existing `voidManualExpense()`. This was needed because, before this phase, void was only
  wired to an unreachable panel (`showManualExpenses`/dead code) — there was no reachable UI path
  to soft-delete *any* manual expense record, imported or manually added. Legacy direct-canonical
  rows (Approved Memo, Infra Cost, and any pre-existing import not present in the manual expense
  store) do not get this button and remain read-only, unchanged.

### Data flow
Before: Excel import (any source) → `importActualSpendRecords()` → written directly to canonical
Actual Spend → permanently retained as-is by `reconcileActualSpendSources()`'s "keep everything
that isn't a projected manual/infra id" rule → **not editable, not soft-deletable**.

After (Manual / Historical rows only): Excel import → `importActualSpendRecords()` (still
validates and writes to canonical first, unchanged) → `promoteImportedManualExpenses()` converts
each Manual/Historical row into a manual expense record, saves it via the same
`saveManualExpenseAsync()` the "Add Expense" form uses, and removes the direct-canonical copy →
`reconcileActualSpendSources()` re-projects it via `manualExpenseToActualSpend()`, identical to a
manually added row → editable via the existing report drill-down, soft-deletable via Void.
Approved Memo and Infra Cost imports are untouched and keep flowing straight to canonical.

### Explicitly NOT changed
- The manual "Add Expense" form: no field, layout, date picker, month picker, frequency-based
  field visibility, Entry Type, or button text changes.
- No Adjustment entry type introduced; Entry Type field left as-is for a later cleanup phase.
- Forecast calculation logic (`calculateForecast`) — untouched.
- Budget vs Actual calculation logic (`calculateBudgetVsActualDataset`) — untouched.
- Budget Pool CRUD — untouched.
- The grouped Actual Spend report layout/table — untouched (only the drill-down panel gained one
  conditional action cell).
- No Report / Manual Entries sub-tabs created.
- Legacy direct-canonical imported records (Approved Memo, Infra Cost, and any import that
  predates this phase) remain read-only reporting records.
- `importActualSpendRecords()` in `app.js` — untouched; still validates and writes every valid
  row to canonical storage exactly as before (this preserves its existing direct unit-test
  contract in `tests/financial-models.test.js`).

### Tests
Added to `tests/budget-expenses.test.js`:
- Excel import of Manual/Historical rows creates editable manual expense records with correct
  one-time and monthly totals (proves no double-counting: `3000` total over 3 months stores as
  `1000`/month and reconstructs to `3000`).
- An imported manual expense record can be edited and the change flows into canonical Actual
  Spend.
- Soft-deleting an imported manual expense excludes it from canonical Actual Spend, Forecast, and
  Budget vs Actual totals.
- Excel import of Approved Memo and Infra Cost rows stays direct-canonical and read-only,
  unaffected by manual expense routing.
- Actual Spend group drill-down offers Void for editable imported manual expense records.

### Test run
- Ran `node --test tests/budget-expenses.test.js tests/financial-models.test.js tests/workflow.test.js`.
- Result: 65 passed, 0 failed.
- JavaScript syntax checks passed for `app.js` and `views/budget.js`.

### Remaining work
- Entry Type field cleanup (possible removal of "Adjustment"/"Other" options) deferred to a later
  UI cleanup phase, per scope.
- Report / Manual Entries sub-tab split deferred, per scope.
